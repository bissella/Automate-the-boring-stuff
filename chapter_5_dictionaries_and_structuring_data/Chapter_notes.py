"""
Dictionaries are like lists but with the key difference:

Lists are ordered by index.
Dictionaries are unordered data sets where data is found by unique Keys.
    Each entry has a Key Value pairing.

Create dictionaries with
 dict = {"key":"value,....}

return value with:

dict['key']

"""

"""
THere are 3 methods for dictionaries that are useful for for loops.

.values()
.items()
"""
"""
OTHER METHODS

.get(key, value if key doesn't exist in dictionary)

This returns a value if the key isn't in the dictionary.

.setdefault() sets the default value for a dictionary if you were to replace it.
