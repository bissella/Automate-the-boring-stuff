    <h1> Flow Control </h1>
<p></p>
    <h3> What do I want to learn? </h3>

    All flow control statements start with a condition which is an expression that always results in a boolean term (True or False).

    Code blocks follow control statements and use indentation to signal where they start and end.

    <h3> What was useful? </h3>
    <p> Diamonds represent branching points of the flow control. Usually a question with different answers flowing out. <br>
Python has 'not' reserved as a comparison term. It's the same as the negative of a logic statement.
      I.e. not False == True
        <br>

        If else statments are the same as they are in R.

        <br>

        <strong> Elif</strong>
        <br>
Elif comparisons put a following if to the else statment. Important note is that in a series of elif statments only one will be true or they will all be false. This  means that after the first elf statement is true, the rest are ignored.
Best practice is to end an elif series with an else statement.

     <strong>While Loops</strong>
        <ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
        <li> Iterate through the flow control while the initial condition is <strong>TRUE</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>This will be useful for optimization algorithms!</li>
        <li>While loops need a negative to break the loop.</li>
        <li> 0, 0.0 and "" (empty string) result in False in python. People use it to write simple while loops.</li>
        <li>name = ''</li>
        <li> while not name:</li>
        <li>    print ('enter name')</li>
        <li>    name = input()</li>
    </ul>
    </p><br>
