    <h1> Reflections from Journey Learning Python through Automate the Boring Stuff </h1>
<p></p>
    <h3> What do I want to learn? </h3>
<p>Python always reduces an expression to a single value. <br>
Putting junk into the console is fine. No problem with getting an error message.</p>
<br>
    The lowest common denominator in python is:<br><br>
    - Values<br>
    - Expressions<br>
    - Operators<br>
<br>
    All expressions simplify to a single value with operators. There are only a few types of data that a final value can be.
<br>
    Unlike HTML and other programs, hypens and dashes are out. Underscores are the way to go!
    <h3> What was useful? </h3>

<p> input() prompts for input from the user in the console. <br>
It can be pulled together by: <br>
spam = int(input())</p>
<h3>What was cool? </h3>
    <p>
        It's cool to have staged input for a script. I am not used to this.
